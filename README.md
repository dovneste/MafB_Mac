## Abstract
<p align="justify">Homeostatic resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are characterized by a remarkable diversity but also share common features that are thought to be driven by conserved transcriptional programs. While the transcription factor MafB is highly expressed in the macrophage lineage, little is known about its role in establishing RTM identity and functions. Here, we found that MafB expression gradually increased during macrophage development and was required for the full development of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and most RTM populations in vivo. The absence of MafB retained RTM in a CD52<sup>high</sup> immature stage associated with a disruption of global and tissue-specific RTM identities and functions across organs, impairing phagocytosis, splenic iron recycling, lung, kidney and gut physiology. Mechanistically, epigenetic profiling of MafB binding sites revealed that MafB directly regulated expression of key RTM differentiation and identity genes in mouse and humans, including Csf1r, Mertk, Fcgr1, Cd163 and Zeb2. Finally, in silico analyses showed that MafB binding sites were highly conserved across vertebrates. Our findings demonstrate the crucial and evolutionarily conserved role of MafB as regulator of RTM development and functional identity, connecting MafB-dependent transcriptional programs with unique defining features of RTMs and tissue homeostasis.</p>
